        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Colorado Symphony Association is the region’s only full-time professional orchestra committed to artistic excellence and ensuring 
            the future of live, symphonic music. Performing over 150 concerts annually at Boettcher Concert Hall in downtown Denver and across 
            Colorado, your Colorado Symphony is home to eighty full-time musicians, representing more than a dozen nations, and regularly welcomes 
            the most celebrated artists from all genres of music. Recognized as an incubator of innovation, creativity, and excellence, your Colorado 
            Symphony continually expands its impact through education, outreach, and programming. We partner with the state’s leading musical artists, 
            cultural organizations, corporations, foundations, sports teams, and individuals to expose diverse audiences to the power of symphonic orchestral 
            music.

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        
        <p>Each season the Colorado Symphony presents a wealth of world-class artistry performed by your critically-acclaimed orchestra, the region’s only 
            full-time professional orchestra. We present performances and/or events almost every weekend, September through May. Concert categories include 
            Classics, Symphony Pops, Spotlight,  Family, Holiday,  Movie at the Symphony, Alternative, and even our Summer performances, which feature numerous 
            concerts at the historic Red Rocks Amphitheater.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to our standard concert season, we’re happy to provide plenty of other fun opportunities for events and activities. Support the symphony 
            by participating in great annual events like the Symphony Gala and social networking opportunities through Colorado Symphony Young Professionals, the 
            Colorado Symphony Guild, Women of Note, and more. Throughout the season you’ll also find pre and post-concert events, like Preludes & Talkbacks, that 
            will make your concert experience extra special. Plus, make a donation to the Colorado Symphony and receive access to special donor events like open 
            rehearsals, happy hours, master classes, and more. </p>
        
            <p>We offer a wide array of experiences that can involve you and your partner, or you can bring the kids for pre-concert HalfNotes activities and special 
            events geared specifically toward their growing knowledge and love of music. With our commitment to serving the community with culturally enriching 
            musical experiences, we hope that you will visit for any one of our special events or performances. Bring your friends—we have events and activities
             for everyone’s tastes!
