    <ul>
        <li> What should I wear to a Colorado Symphony concert?</li> 
        <p>Contrary to what many people think, formal attire like tuxedos and evening gowns are not required. They aren’t even the norm! Most concert-goers wear business or cocktail attire, but you’ll see everything from jeans and t-shirts to suits and ties. The name of the game is comfort.</p>
        <li> What if I am late to the concert?</li> 
        <p>For the comfort and enjoyment of our musicians and patrons, late seating is at the discretion of the House Manager and takes place during pauses in the program. The ushers will let you know when you may enter the hall. They may seat you in an area other than your ticketed seat so as to not disturb other patrons, and you may take your ticketed seat during intermission.</p>
        <li> What is your cell phone/photo/video policy?</li>
        <p>We ask that you please silence your cell phones and refrain from talking or texting on them during performances. Flash photography is prohibited at all times.</p>

        <p>Program length varies, but a typical performance lasts about two hours, including one 20 minute intermission.
